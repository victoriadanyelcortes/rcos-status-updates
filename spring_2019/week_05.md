## Last Week's Accomplishments
> This past week, I was able to implement an algorithim to modify the listings
> in place in order to prevent the side bar redraw.

## This Week's Plan
> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to refactor the code to 
> decrease the run time from O(N^2) to O(N).

## Anything Blocking?

> I am unsure of how to correctly implement the change from an array to a set.

## Notes

> N/A
