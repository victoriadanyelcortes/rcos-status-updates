## Notes

> Overall, I learned a lot this semester. I've never worked on a project, even of my own. I feel that I am much more confident in my knowledge of how to program, and I feel much more comfortable approaching problems that I would not have known how to previously. Additionally, I have learned a lot about Angular and front end technologies, and I feel confident that I would be able to develop a website of my own in the near future, which was the knowledge I had hoped to gain throughout the course. Additionally, I have a stronger grasp on runtime and algorithims, which is essential.
