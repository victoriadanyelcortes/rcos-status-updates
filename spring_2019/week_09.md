## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to test the initial implemetation of the copy schedule link feature. While it did not work, I realized where the mistake was.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to adjust the code I wrote to accurately copy the schedule link. I also intend to follow up with the issue related to the copy schedule link feature once it has been implemeted on the new site.

## Anything Blocking?

> I realized the current URL was not the same as the link I was aiming to copy. I will need to adapt my implemetation.

## Notes
