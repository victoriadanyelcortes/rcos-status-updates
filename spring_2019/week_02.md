## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I began working on issue #400, and contributing to YACS. The issue arises from this.listings() being \
> reset each time a new selection is made, so I came up with a solution for this that I hope to implement soon. \
>  I also started a tutorial on CSS.

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to continue implementing the solution I came up with for the issue, and \
> hopefully close the issue. \
> I also plan to work through the CSS tutorial more.

## Anything Blocking?

> I had some issues with running YACS, and was unable to test any code, but I asked my mentors to help resolve this issue.
